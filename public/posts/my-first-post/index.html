<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>This is my attempt at a semi personal website.
I&rsquo;m kind of a Software Developer who goes by the nickname &ldquo;Prot3us&rdquo;.
I don&rsquo;t know how you got here, but now that you are here I want to welcome you!</p>
<p>Prot3us, a kind of pseudonym of my internet persona.
Under this pseudonym I want to log in this website some of my thoughts, ideas, maybe a few experiences that I&rsquo;ve had in this planet we call Earth.
Not to bore you to death, I&rsquo;de like you to know that I develop mostly web applications but, I really prefer the backend stuff, algorithms and weird puzzles.
Also, I can be a nerd for developer tools, like Neovim and Tmux.</p>
<p>Here you can expect, my thoughts biased in my own experiences, under a pseudonym I have no reason to appeal to any specific target.
I&rsquo;ll share my projects (currently working on a bitcoin DCA bot.
And I&rsquo;m hopping to connect with you, you can reach me via email TKTK.</p>
<p>Grab a coffee, settle into your chair and let&rsquo;s explore the the curious world of software development.</p>
