## Introduction
Hello World!

This is my attempt at a semi personal website.
I'm kind of a Software Developer who goes by the nickname "Prot3us".
I don't know how you got here, but now that you are here I want to welcome you!

Prot3us, a kind of pseudonym of my internet persona.
Under this pseudonym I want to log in this website some of my thoughts, ideas, maybe a few experiences that I've had in this planet we call Earth.
Not to bore you to death, I'de like you to know that I develop mostly web applications but, I really prefer the backend stuff, algorithms and weird puzzles.
Also, I can be a nerd for developer tools, like Neovim and Tmux.

Here you can expect, my thoughts biased in my own experiences, under a pseudonym I have no reason to appeal to any specific target.
I'll share my projects (currently working on a bitcoin DCA bot.
And I'm hopping to connect with you, you can reach me via email TKTK.

Grab a coffee, settle into your chair and let's explore the the curious world of software development.
